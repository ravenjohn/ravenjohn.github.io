Hallo! I'm Raven, an overthinker, capable of zoning out for a whole minute to think about every single possible thing that can happen because of a single thing you said. Only to continue thinking again before I sleep. I watch a lot of anime and play a lot of Dota 2.

### Work

I'm a web developer and I mostly do the following: 

* RESTful APIs using node.js including database design
* bots for browser automation using [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/)
* Node.js libraries, see [@rvnjl](https://www.npmjs.com/~rvnjl) and [@anytv_npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/~anytv_npmjs)
* chrome extensions

Currently working at [MCN Freedom Tech Inc.](https://www.freedom.tm). We make tools to help YouTubers grow. Check out [freedom.tm](https://www.freedom.tm), [spam.tm](http://spam.tm), [upload.tm](http://upload.tm), and [Heartbeat](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/heartbeat/aailiojlhjbichheofhdpcongebcgcgm?hl=en).

I do front-end using pure vanilla since I'm not really into frameworks due to their instablility. Also, I sometimes do web designs but they are not always great so I'm not focusing on it.
