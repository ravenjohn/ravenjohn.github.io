Hallo! I'm Raven, an overthinker, capable of <span id="capability"></span>

### Work

I'm a full-stack web developer and I mostly do the following: 

* RESTful APIs using node.js including database design
* bots for browser automation using [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/)
* Node.js libraries, see [@rvnjl](https://www.npmjs.com/~rvnjl) and [@anytv_npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/~anytv_npmjs)
* chrome extensions

Currently working at [MCN Freedom Tech Inc.](https://www.freedom.tm) and as [a freelancer](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01c85b997c4d862268). We make tools to help YouTubers grow. Check out [freedom.tm](https://www.freedom.tm), [spam.tm](http://spam.tm), [upload.tm](http://upload.tm), and [Heartbeat](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/heartbeat/aailiojlhjbichheofhdpcongebcgcgm?hl=en).

I do front-end using [VanillaJS](http://vanilla-js.com/) or [Angular 2](https://angular.io/). Also, I sometimes do web designs but they are not always great so I'm not focusing on it.
