Hallo! I'm Raven, an overthinker, capable of lagging for a whole minute to think about every single possible thing that can happen because of one thing you said.

### Work

I'm a web developer and I mostly do: 

* RESTful APIs using node.js including database design
* bots for browser automation using [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/)
* Node.js libraries, see [@rvnjl](https://www.npmjs.com/~rvnjl) and [@anytv_npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/~anytv_npmjs)
* chrome extensions

Currently working at [MCN Freedom Tech Inc.](https://www.freedom.tm). We do tools for YouTubers to grow. Check out [freedom.tm](http://www.freedom.tm), [spam.tm](http://freedom.tm), [upload.tm](http://upload.tm), and [Heartbeat](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/heartbeat/aailiojlhjbichheofhdpcongebcgcgm?hl=en).

I do know how to do front-end stuff but I don't like it due to its ultra fast metabolism. Also, I sometimes do web designs but they are not always great so I'm not focusing on it.
