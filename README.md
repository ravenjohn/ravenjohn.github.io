Hallo! I love **JavaScript** and I mostly do: 

* RESTful APIs using node.js including database design
* bots for browser automation using [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/)
* Node.js libraries, see [@rvnjl](https://www.npmjs.com/~rvnjl) and [@anytv_npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/~anytv_npmjs)
* chrome extensions

I'm currently working at [MCN Freedom Tech Inc.](https://www.freedom.tm) as a full-time developer. We do tools for YouTubers to grow. Check out [freedom.tm](http://www.freedom.tm), [spam.tm](http://freedom.tm), [upload.tm](http://upload.tm), and [Heartbeat](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/heartbeat/aailiojlhjbichheofhdpcongebcgcgm?hl=en).

Anyway, I'm always open for new opportunities. Hit me up at rjlagrimas08 at gmail.com
