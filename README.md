Hi! I'm a web developer. I love JavaScript and I mostly do: 
- web services using node.js
- bots for web automation using phantomjs
- Chrome extension

I'm currently working at [MCN Freedom Tech Inc.](https://www.freedom.tm) as a full-time developer but I'm always open for oppurtunities. Hit me up at rjlagrimas08 at gmail.com
